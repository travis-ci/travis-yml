# Flags used here, not in `make html`:
#  -n   Run in nit-picky mode. Currently, this generates warnings for all missing references.
#  -W   Turn warnings into errors. This means that the build stops at the first warning and sphinx-build exits with exit status 1.
#  -T   Displays the full stack trace if an unhandled exception occurs.
#  -b   Linkcheck builder checks for broken links.
