# We define the job matrix explicitly, in order to minimize the
# combinations.
# For OS-X, using an explicit matrix is required, because Travis at
# this point only has half-baked support for Python on OS-X that does
# not work. Also, on OS-X, it needs to be invoked with language=generic
# and an empty 'python' variable in order to prevent that Travis attempts
# to install Python.
# TODO: Figure out how specific versions of Python 3.x can be used with OS-X

# When defining the job matrix explicitly, there are Travis environments
# that produce an additional default job. See these Travis issues:
#   https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1228
#   https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/4681
#   https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9843
# The public Travis does not seem to have this issue anymore,
# but Travis@IBM does have this issue (as of 9/2018). The workaround for
# this issue is to define variables globally and to exclude this same
# variable value in the matrix definition. Experiments have shown that
# not all variable combinations work. Using a combination of 'language'
# and 'os' set to the default values works.

# See note about explicit job matrix, above.

  # Reason for setting up a Python virtualenv on OS-X:
  # Some Ansible scripts are invoked directly from the cloned Ansible repo
  # directory, so their hashbang is '/usr/bin/env python'. This requires
  # that the 'python' command and environment is the desired one. On OS-X,
  # when installing Python 3, only the 'python3' command invokes Python 3,
  # but the 'python' command invokes Python 2. Therefore, a virtualenv is
  # needed in which the desired Python version is available as the
  # 'python'. command. Travis does not set up a virtualenv on its OS-X
  # machines, so we need to do that here.
